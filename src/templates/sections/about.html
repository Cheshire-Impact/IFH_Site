                        <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
                        <p>IFH seeks to build a strong, multi-directional referral ecosystem of financial services
                            companies
                            through acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth. IFH continued to actively build
                            that
                            ecosystem last year, instituting several transformational changes: IFH divested its
                            ownership in
                            Sound Bank, expanded product offerings aligned to create synergies with its primary focus on
                            government guaranteed lending and launched several initiatives designed to increase deposits
                            within
                            new, targeted underserved industries. IFH is committed
                            to embracing a spirit of entrepreneurship
                            and strategic growth initiatives in an effort to advance the Organizationâ€™s overall
                            financial core
                            competencies for its small business customers throughout the United States.</p>
