                <h3>WHAT WE DO</h3>
                <p>IFH seeks to build a strong, multi-directional referral ecosystem of financial services
                    companies
                    through acquisitions, joint ventures and organic growth. IFH continued to actively build
                    that
                    ecosystem last year, instituting several transformational changes: IFH divested its
                    ownership in
                    Sound Bank, expanded product offerings aligned to create synergies with its primary
                    focus on
                    government guaranteed lending and launched several initiatives designed to increase
                    deposits
                    within
                    new, targeted underserved industries. IFH is committed
                    to embracing a spirit of entrepreneurship
                    and strategic growth initiatives in an effort to advance the Organizationâ€™s overall
                    financial core
                    competencies for its small business customers throughout the United States.</p>
